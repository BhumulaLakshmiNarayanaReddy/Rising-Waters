# 🌊 Raising Water – AI Powered Flood Prediction System

## Project Overview

Raising Water is a Machine Learning-based Flood Prediction System designed to predict the likelihood of flood occurrence using historical weather and rainfall data. The project integrates data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, machine learning model comparison, and deployment into a complete prediction pipeline.

The application analyzes environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, cloud cover, and seasonal rainfall to determine whether flood conditions are likely to occur. The trained model is deployed using Flask, allowing users to enter weather information through a web interface and receive instant predictions.

The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate the complete Machine Learning lifecycle—from raw data preprocessing to real-time prediction through a web application.

# Problem Statement

Floods are one of the most devastating natural disasters, causing significant damage to life, infrastructure, and agriculture. Traditional flood forecasting methods often require complex hydrological simulations and extensive monitoring systems.

This project presents an AI-based approach that predicts flood occurrence using historical weather and rainfall data. By leveraging Machine Learning algorithms, the system can generate predictions quickly and efficiently, supporting early decision-making and disaster preparedness.

# Project Workflow

## 1. Data Collection

The flood dataset is collected and loaded into the project for analysis.

---

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (**EDA**) is performed to understand the dataset before model training.

The analysis includes:

- Dataset structure
- Feature information
- Statistical summary
- Missing value analysis
- Data distribution
- Correlation analysis
- Heatmaps
- Boxplots
- Histograms

---

## 3. Data Preprocessing

The dataset is preprocessed to improve model performance.

### Missing Values

Missing values are detected and handled appropriately.

### Outlier Detection

Outliers are identified using the Interquartile Range (**IQR**) method.

### Outlier Treatment

Instead of removing outliers, **IQR**-based capping is applied to preserve the dataset size while reducing the impact of extreme values.

---

## Feature Selection

The input features are separated from the target variable before model training.

```python X = Input Features y = Target Variable ```

---

## Train-Test Split

The dataset is divided into training and testing subsets to evaluate the performance of the machine learning models on unseen data.

---

## Feature Scaling

`StandardScaler` is used to normalize the numerical features so that all input variables have a similar scale.

The fitted scaler is saved using **Joblib** and reused during deployment, ensuring that user inputs are transformed in exactly the same way as the training data.

---

# Machine Learning Models Used

Four supervised machine learning classification algorithms were implemented and evaluated.

## 1. Decision Tree Classifier

A supervised learning algorithm that recursively splits the dataset based on feature values to classify flood and non-flood conditions.

---

## 2. Random Forest Classifier

An ensemble learning algorithm that combines multiple Decision Trees to improve prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting.

---

## 3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

A distance-based classification algorithm that predicts the class of a new sample based on the majority class of its nearest neighbors.

---

## 4. XGBoost Classifier

An advanced gradient boosting algorithm that sequentially improves prediction performance by correcting the errors made by previous trees.

XGBoost demonstrated the most consistent performance and was selected as the final deployment model.

---

# Model Evaluation

Each machine learning model was evaluated using standard classification metrics.

### Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score

# Model Performance

| Machine Learning Model    |                             Accuracy                            |
| ------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------: |
| Decision Tree             |                            **95.65%**                           |
| Random Forest             |                            **95.65%**                           |
| K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) |                            **86.95%** |
| XGBoost                   |                            **86.95%**                           |

Although Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost achieved similar accuracy, **XGBoost** was selected as the final deployment model because of its superior generalization capability, robustness, and stability on structured datasets.

# Model Saving

To avoid retraining the model every time the application starts, the trained model and scaler are saved using the **Joblib** library.

### Saved Files

```text
backend/
└── models/
    ├── flood_model.pkl
    └── scaler.pkl
```

The Flask application loads these files during startup and uses them to preprocess user inputs and generate real-time flood predictions.

---

# Deployment

The trained Machine Learning model is deployed using the Flask web framework.
